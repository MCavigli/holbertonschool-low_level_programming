In this project we learng about functions and nested loops.

**TASK 0**
Write a program that prints Holberton, followed by a new line.
* The program should return 0

**TASK 1**
Write a function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
* Prototype: void print_alphabet(void);
* You can only use _putchar twice in your code

**TASK 2**
Write a function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
* Prototype: void print_alphabet_x10(void);
* You can only use _putchar twice in your code

**TASK 3**
Write a function that checks for lowercase character.
* Prototype: int _islower(int c);
* Returns 1 if c is lowercase
* Returns 0 otherwise
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: islower. Run man islower to learn more.

**TASK 4**
Write a function that checks for alphabetic character.
* Prototype: int _isalpha(int c);
* Returns 1 if c is a letter, lowercase or uppercase
* Returns 0 otherwise
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: isalpha. Run man isalpha to learn more.

**TASK 5**
Write a function that prints the sign of a number.
* Prototype: int print_sign(int n);
* Returns 1 and prints + if n is greater than zero
* Returns 0 and prints 0 if n is zero
* Returns -1 and prints - if n is less than zero

**TASK 6**
Write a function that computes the absolute value of an integer.
* Prototype: int _abs(int);
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: abs. Run man abs to learn more.

**TASK 7**
Write a function that prints the last digit of a number.
* Prototype: int print_last_digit(int);
* Returns the value of the last digit

**TASK 8**
Write a function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.
* Prototype: void jack_bauer(void);

**TASK 9**
Write a function that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.
* Prototype: void times_table(void)

**TASK 10**
Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result.
* Prototype: int add(int, int);

**TASK 11**
Write a function that prints all natural numbers from n to 98, followed by a new line.
* Prototype: void print_to_98(int n);
* Numbers must be separated by a comma, followed by a space
* Numbers should be printed in order
* The first printed number should be the number passed to your function
* The last printed number should be 98
* You are allowed to use the standard library
