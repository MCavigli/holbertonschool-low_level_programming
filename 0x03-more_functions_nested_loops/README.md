In this project, we go a little further into nested loops in C as well as
explore header files further.

**TASK 0**
Write a function that checks for uppercase character.
* Prototype: int _isupper(int c);
* Returns 1 if c is uppercase
* Returns 0 otherwise

**TASK 1**
Write a function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).
* Prototype: int _isdigit(int c);
* Returns 1 if c is a digit
* Returns 0 otherwise

**TASK 2**
Write a function that multiplies two integers.
* Prototype: int mul(int a, int b);

**TASK 3**
Write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.
* Prototype: void print_numbers(void);
* You can only use _putchar twice in your code

**TASK 4**
Write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.
* Prototype: void print_most_numbers(void);
* Do not print 2 and 4
* You can only use _putchar twice in your code

**TASK 5**
Write a function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line.
* Prototype: void more_numbers(void);
* You can only use _putchar three times in your code

**TASK 6**
Write a function that draws a straight line in the terminal.
* Prototype: void print_line(int n);
* You can only use _putchar function to print
* Where n is the number of times the character _ should be printed
* The line should end with a \n
* If n is 0 or less, the function should only print \n

**TASK 7**
Write a function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.
* Prototype: void print_diagonal(int n);
* You can only use _putchar function to print
* Where n is the number of times the character \ should be printed
* The diagonal should end with a \n
* If n is 0 or less, the function should only print a \n

**TASK 8**
Write a function that prints a square, followed by a new line.
* Prototype: void print_square(int size);
* You can only use _putchar function to print
* Where size is the size of the square
* If size is 0 or less, the function should print only a new line
* Use the character # to print the square

**TASK 9**
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.
* Each number or word should be separated by a space
* You are allowed to use the standard library

**TASK 10**
Write a function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line.
* Prototype: void print_triangle(int size);
* You can only use _putchar function to print
* Where size is the size of the triangle
* If size is 0 or less, the function should print only a new line
* Use the character # to print the triangle
