We're going a little deeper learning C. Today we'll be working with loops and if statements.

**TASK 0**
This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.
* if the number is greater than 0: is positive
* if the number is 0: is zero
* if the number is less than 0: is negative

**TASK 1**
This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.
* if n is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5
* if n is 0: the string and is 0
* if n is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0

**TASK 2**
Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
* You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
* All your code should be in the main function
* You can only use putchar twice in your code

**TASK 3**
Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
* Print all the letters except q and e
* You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
* All your code should be in the main function
* You can only use putchar twice in your code

**TASK 4**
Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.
* You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
* All your code should be in the main function
* You can only use putchar three times in your code

**TASK 5**
Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
* All your code should be in the main function

**TASK 6**
Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
* You are not allowed to use any variable of type char
* You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
* You can only use putchar twice in your code
* All your code should be in the main function

**TASK 7**
Write a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.
* You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
* All your code should be in the main function
* You can only use putchar twice in your code

**TASK 8**
Write a program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.
* You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
* All your code should be in the main function
* You can only use putchar three times in your code

**TASK 9**
Write a program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.
* Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space
* Numbers should be printed in ascending order
* You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
* All your code should be in the main function
* You can only use putchar four times maximum in your code
* You are not allowed to use any variable of type char

**TASK 10**
Write a program that prints the numbers from 00 to 99.
* Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space
* Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with two digits
* You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden)
* You can only use putchar five times maximum in your code
* You are not allowed to use any variable of type char
* All your code should be in the main function
